    <h2>Hi! I'm Jared.</h2>
    <p>I'm an undergraduate at MIT studying Aerospace Engineering with an interest in control systems, robotics, and autonomy. I'm currently working in the Aerospace Controls Laboratory on campus developing better control systems for drones. I'm also studying Mandarin Chinese!</p>
    <p>I love travelling -- I've been to Peru, Ecuador, and all over China. In my free time you can find me watching anime, skateboarding, or playing basketball with my friends.</p>
